# DocuFlow: Documentation made easy. 
Challenge 3.2 â€“ Capturing and finding knowledge  

 
## Background 

A language AI (Artificial Intelligence) model is a type of artificial intelligence system that is trained to understand and generate human-like language. An example for this is GPT-3, a powerful language model developed by OpenAI that has been trained on a large corpus of text data, allowing it to generate human-like language output with high accuracy. This language model has been used in various applications, such as content creation, chatbots, and language translation, and is popular among companies for its ability to automate text-related tasks in different styles and formats. The AI language model known as Davinci, which can generate text, answer questions, and perform various language-related tasks, is one of the most notable uses of GPT-3. 

 

## Problem Statement 

The problem of creating effective and detailed documentation is a common challenge faced by many organizations, especially those with a large workforce spread across multiple locations and business units. The task of documenting knowledge and experience can be time-consuming, especially when it needs to be tailored to different audiences with varying levels of technical or functional expertise. Additionally, the process of documenting information for future use can also be complex, as it requires capturing and organizing information from a variety of sources, such as projects, assignments, training, and other sources of knowledge. 

This leads to a situation where the creation of documentation becomes a bottleneck in the workflow, slowing down the overall process and reducing the efficiency of the organization. An example of this bottleneck within Tietoevry can be for instance be seen within Banking, where there is common wiki shared as a centralised knowledge-hub. However, the documentation quality and completeness vary tremendously within the Wiki, depending on the author and team that created it. 

 

## Solution Statement 

To solve the problem of slow and time-consuming documentation creation, we propose a solution that leverages the power of language AI models to automate the process and make it more efficient. The main function of our idea is to create an AI-powered knowledge management system to automate the documentation creation process through capturing knowledge and experience from various sources, making it easily findable, and tailoring it to specific audiences, locations, and business scenarios. 


### Key Features: 

* Automated Documentation Creation: AI language models will be used to generate documentation based on the information inputted into the system, reducing the time and effort required to create it manually. 

* Tagging System: The generated documentation will be tagged with relevant keywords and categories, making it easy to search and find the desired information. 

* Customisation: The generated documentation will be tailored to specific audiences, locations, and business scenarios, making it more relevant and useful to the end-users. 

* Knowledge Management: The system will act as a centralised repository for knowledge and experience, making it easier to find and access the information when needed. 

 
### Design Description:  

The system will have a user-friendly interface that will allow employees to input information, search for existing information, and access the generated documentation. The backend will leverage the capabilities of language AI models to generate the documentation and tag it with relevant keywords and categories. The system will also have customisation options to tailor the generated documentation to specific audiences, locations, and business scenarios. 

 

## Long-term Potential 

The long-term usage of the created centralised knowledge hub solution could be to automate Q&A processes by leveraging the knowledge base. This could involve creating an AI chatbot that can answer questions based on the information contained within the knowledge hub. Furthermore, the knowledge management system could be integrated into the existing workflow of Tietoevry, for instance, by leveraging the CV Partner platform to match experts to certain knowledge topics. 

Finally, the solution could also be marketed to customers as white-labelled solution. The use of solution would allow the creation of high-quality, accurate, and tailored documentation quickly and easily. 

In terms of value-add, the solution could provide several benefits to customers, including: 

* Improved accuracy and consistency in documentation 
* More efficient and streamlined knowledge management processes 
* Increased accessibility to information and expertise 
* Better collaboration and sharing of knowledge and information within the organization 
* Increased productivity and efficiency 

By offering these benefits, the solution could help businesses to improve their overall performance, increase the effectiveness of their operations, and ultimately drive better outcomes for their customers and stakeholders.
